## Reporting A Vulnerability

Use GitHub Security Advisories for private vulnerability reports:

```text
https://github.com/SilverFuel/xeneon-widgets/security/advisories/new
```

Before a paid public launch, add a monitored security inbox to `support.html`, checkout receipts, and release notes.

Please include:

- affected version
- operating system
- a clear reproduction path
- whether local secrets, local network devices, or installer behavior are involved

Do not publish exploit details until a fix is available.

## Security Expectations

- Paid/stable Windows releases must be code-signed. Unsigned free beta builds must be labeled clearly.
- Paid/stable macOS releases must be Developer ID signed and notarized. Unsigned Mac beta builds must be labeled clearly.
- API keys and integration secrets must stay out of plain JSON config.
- Local API endpoints should remain bound to `127.0.3.1`.
- Customers must be able to reset local app data without editing files by hand.
